Their families, the Montagues and Capulets, have been locked in a bitter rivalry for generations. Romeo, a Montague, secretly marries Juliet, a Capulet, with the help of Friar Lawrence. When Romeo kills Juliet's cousin Tybalt in a fight, he is banished. A plan to reunite the lovers goes wrong when Romeo believes Juliet is dead (she has taken a sleeping potion). He poisons himself at her tomb, and when Juliet awakens to find Romeo dead, she kills herself. Their deaths finally end the family feud.",
